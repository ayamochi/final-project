<h3>Anna Waldbaum</h3>
<p class="Annabio">Hi, I'm Anna.  I'm 16 and I'm a rising junior at School of the Future.  I am an active member of band, science club, and Operation Smile.  I decided to join the Kode With Klossy program because I felt coding was a necessary education to learn a new skill, and would be most succesful in an environment of curious and inteligent young women. </p>
<h3>Alex Woodruff</h3>
<p class="Alexbio">Hi, I'm Alex.  I'm 13 and I'm going into 8th grade at the Avery Coonley School.  I am member of Student Council, where I serve as a D.R. for the IAJHSC.  I'm also a part of the drama, art, choir, orchestra clubs, as well as partcipating on the volleyball and basketball teams.  I joined Kode with Klossy because after 4 years of Girls who Code, I had not refined my skills as a coder, so why not do a 2 week bootcamp to truly understand it.</p>
<h3>Ayano Mochizuki</h3>
<p class="Ayanobio">Hi, I'm Ayano.  I'm 15 and I'm a rising junior at School of the Future.  I am a participant in science, writing, feminist, and drawing clubs. Before Kode with Klossy, I didnâ€™t know much about coding. But then I started hearing about the importance of coding from friends at school and I have read many articles that stated how coding can be useful in many different career paths. Kode with Klossy was something I found on Karlie's Youtube channel. I liked their goal of getting more girls in the STEM field, and how everyone was collaborating.</p>
