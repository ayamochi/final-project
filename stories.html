<p class="U.S. Women’s soccer team">“The fact that women players get paid less than their male counterparts is not in dispute. What US Soccerclaimed in response to the lawsuit is that the pay gap is ‘based on differences in the aggregate revenue generated by the different teams and/or any other factor other than sex.’ In other words, since the men bring in more money, they get paid more, too.”</p>

<p class="Aileen Rizo"> “Aileen Rizo works as a math consultant at a California county office that supports dozens of school districts. After three years on the job, she said she learned over lunch that a man just hired as a math consultant had started at a much higher salary. After trying unsuccessfully to work out the disparity with human resources, Rizo filed a lawsuit because of her two young daughters. ‘I don’t want another girl to feel after she’s worked so hard that she’s not worth the same as the man sitting next to her,’Rizo said.”</p>

<p class="Reshma Daniel">“Reshma Daniel’s parents moved to America from India with just $20. Her parents wanted their children to live the American dream. For Daniel, that means law school. While at Nova Southeastern University in Florida, she majored in legal studies and job shadowed a family lawyer. Following a pretrial hearing, another lawyer, a Vietnamese woman, told Daniel that she should not become a lawyer. ‘She was like, “You won’t get paid. As a woman and of color, you’re going to be underpaid, so there’s really no point,”’ Daniel recalled.”</p>

<p class="Ellie Setser">“Ellie Setser and her female colleagues in a research lab at a teaching hospital fought pay discrimination in the late 1970s. The technicians in Setser’s lab were all women with college degrees. They learned that a male head technician without a degree — working in a much smaller lab with less responsibility — earned a salary 1.5 times larger than the female head technician in Setser’s lab. The women banded together and called in anonymous complaints to a U.S. Department of Justice pay discrimination hotline. To their surprise, an investigation — and pay raises — followed.”</p>
